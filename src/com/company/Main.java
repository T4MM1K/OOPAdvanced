        // Inheritance has to do with a parent-child (is-a) relationship.
        // Usually the child is a type of the parent.
        // E.g. A gorilla is an animal. In inheritance, the properties and methods of the
        // parent class are inherited by the child class.

        // Composition has to do with a 'part-of' relationship. One of the
        // objects is composed or is a part/component of the other.
        // E.g. Rooms make up a house.

        // Abstraction has to do with creating generic ways to build more objects.
        // Using abstraction, you can build for one type and extend it to other
        // beautiful or more complex or specialized ways to use them.
        // E.g. You can create a vehicle and implement various vehicles, like cars, motorcycles, bicycles etc.

        // Encapsulation is enclosing aspects of an object into one unit. You can then decide
        // what parts of information from that unit or object you want to be exposed.
        // I.e. You can create readonly or write-only classes.

        // Polymorphism is about creating multi-functionality. There are two main types:
        // overloading and overriding. Overloading is creating multiple methods with the same
        // name probably to do the same thing but they have to possess different method signatures,
        // i.e. different number or quality (data types) of parameters. Overriding on the other hand
        // has to do with customizing functionality of methods inherited from a parent class or an interface.

        // Exercises:
        // Write an interface called Shape, inside of Shape, build two methods called,
        // area and perimeter. Create child classes for the following shapes: Rectangle,
        // Circle, Triangle, Square, and ensure they return the correct results.
        // Make it interactive, such that users can enter input for the respective shapes
        // and get the desired output.
        // E.g. "The area of the rectangle is: 4"
